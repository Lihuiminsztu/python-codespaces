# Computational Chemistry Projects

This repository contains Python code and computational tools for studying CO adsorption on ice Ih surfaces.

## Project Structure

- `BindingEnergy/`: Main simulation code for calculating binding energies
  - `COonIh/`: Specific modules for CO adsorption on ice Ih
    - `src/`: Source code including absorption.py and test_with_logging.py
    - `ReadMe.md`: Detailed documentation

## Key Features

- Automated creation of Ice Ih surfaces with specified Miller indices
- Support for different adsorption sites (ontop, bridge, hollow)
- Flexible molecule orientation and positioning options
- Record-keeping of simulation parameters and results
- Calculation of binding energies using GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB methods

## Blog

I've documented my learning journey and the development of this project in a blog:
