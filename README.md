# Computational Chemistry Projects

This repository contains Python code and computational tips for Astrophysics and Astrochemistry Projects. Calculates structural and chemical parameters of interstellar ices with quantum mechanical methods.

## Project Structure
As for now, there is just two files that can be used for calculations or modeling.

- `BindingEnergy/`: Main simulation code for calculating binding energies
  - `COonIh/`: Specific modules for CO adsorption on ice Ih
    - `src/`: Source code including absorption.py and test_with_logging.py etc...
    - `ReadMe.md`: Detailed documentation
  
This project employs GFN1/GFN2-xTB semi-empirical quantum mechanical methods within the TBLite framework to efficiently calculate binding energies of interstellar molecules on ice surfaces, optimizing convergence through modified SCF parameters.

## Future work
- Future integration with machine learning for enhanced predictions.Sametime, i will import DFT method to calculate more models.

## Blog

I've documented my learning journey and the development of this project in a blog:

[**View My Computational Chemistry Learning Blog**](https://lihuiminsztu.github.io/python-codespaces/)

The blog includes detailed explanations of the computational methods, code evolution, and scientific insights gained during this project.
