## Introduction to Hexagonal Ice

The I in 'ice Ih' is Roman numeral for one, as this was the first water ice found. 
In the chemistry, variations in pressure and temperature give rise to different phases of ice, which have varying propeties and molecular geometries. On Earth, most ice is found in the phase of Hexagonal ice Ih. It has a specific crystal structure with oxygen atoms arranged in a hexagonal pattern. While the oxygen atoms maintain this ordered hexagonal framework, the hydrogen atoms can adopt different orientation while still obeying the Bernal-Fowler Rules. This hydrogen disorder is a key characteristic of ice Ih that distinguishes it from some other ice polymorphs. Before modify the structure of ice Ih, it's need to get what is Bernal-Fowler Rules.

## Bernal-Fowler Rules

Bernal-Fowler Rules is basic principles that govern arrangement of atoms in water ice and also in ice Ih. These rules describe the arrangement of hydrogens atoms in an ideal ice crystal. Some Key rules:
- 1. Each oxygen atom connects two hydrogen atoms such that the water molecule structure is preserved.
- 2. The orientation of two hydrogen atoms is facing to two of four surrounding oxygen atoms. These arrangements almost result in a tetrahedral.
- 3. Only one hydrogen atom is present on each O-O linkage.


## Basic Lattice properties

### Atomic positions and coordination

In ice Ih, the oxygen atom lie on two intersecting hexagonal lattices. There totally exists **24** unique water orientations Because a minimum of **4** water is needed per unit cell and the hydrogen atom cna be arranged in **6** different ways for each water molecule at a given positions. Each of the arrangements for each site is listed in Table I in terms of orthogonal unit vectors representing the molecular symmetry (**a**) and in-plane (**b**) axes.

And then from this table the displayments **$R_1$** & **$R_2$** of the actual hydrogen atoms can be obtained:
$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{R_1} = R_{OH}\cos{\frac{\theta}{2}}\textbf{a} + R_{OH}\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}\textbf{b} \\ \mathbf{R_2} = R_{OH}\cos{\frac{\theta}{2}} - R_{OH}\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}\textbf{b}
\end{align}
$$

where the $R_{OH}$ is the O-H bond length and $\theta$ is the $\angle \text{HOH}$.
Any number of basic four-molecule unit cell can be included in a large unit. By default, this combined cell allow for more random hydrogen orientations. Following show a construction example which is two of these basic unit combined:

Remove the two molecules at the hexagonal junction and get the why a minimum of 4 water is needed. Take this image as an example, **a** represents the molecular symmetry axis (which bisects the H-O-H angle) and **b** is the in-plane axis perpendicular to it. Together, these two vectors define the orientation of each water molecule within the crystal lattice. 


### Space group
It's an essential concept in crystallography that provides a mathematical description of how atoms are arranged in a crystal. A space group is a mathematical description that combines:
1. **Translational symmetry** (how the pattern repeats in space)
2. **Point group symmetry** (rotations, reflections, inversions, etc.)

For ice Ih, the space group is **P6₃/mmc**, which means:
- **P**: Primitive unit cell (one lattice point per unit cell)
- **6₃**: 6-fold screw axis (rotation by 60° followed by translation)
- **/m**: Mirror plane perpendicular to the c-axis
- **mc**: Mirror plane and glide plane in other directions


## Criteria Used For Selecting Unit Cells

### Continuous

All unit cells generated are think as the constrains and the hydrogen-bonding network is continuous, unbroken and complete. Each water molecular is hydrogen bonded to four neighboring water molecules.

### Zero net dipole moment

Dipole moment is a property of individual water molecules and variable in ice ih due to hydrogen disorder. 
In the physical accuracy side, real bulk ice Ih in nature has zero dipole moment.Each molecule has a dipole moment, but in a large enough sample, these dipoles are oriented randomly following Bernal-Fowler rules, causing the net dipole to average to zero.
In another side which is computational considerations,
1. **Periodic Boundary Conditions**: Most molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations use periodic boundary conditions. A unit cell with a net dipole moment would create artificial electric fields when repeated infinitely, leading to unrealistic polarization effects.

2. **Convergence Issues**: Simulations with net dipole moments often suffer from poor convergence, as the large-scale electrostatic interactions become challenging to calculate accurately.

3. **Artificial Forces**: The artificial electric fields created by a non-zero dipole moment would generate unphysical forces on atoms, affecting dynamics and equilibrium properties.

So zero net dipole moment is esential for ice Ih model.
